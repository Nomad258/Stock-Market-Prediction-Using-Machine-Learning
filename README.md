Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project is a stock price prediction tool that uses Machine Learning (Linear Regression) to analyze historical stock data and predict future prices. The results are visualized and saved into an Excel file with charts.

🛠 Features

✅ Customizable stock selection (User inputs the stock ticker)

✅ Custom date range selection (User inputs start and end date)

✅ Technical indicators (50-day & 200-day Moving Averages, Daily Returns)

✅ Linear Regression Model for predictions

✅ Automatically formatted Excel reports

📊 Actual vs Predicted Price Graph (Saved in a separate Excel sheet)

🔍 Auto-adjusted column widths

✅ Exported reports:

Excel File (.xlsx) with results & graphs
